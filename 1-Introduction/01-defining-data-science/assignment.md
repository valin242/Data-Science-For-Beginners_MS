# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | Improve education process for children in schools | test scores, post-lecutre quizze scores, engagment score, HW score | table | Frequency of correct questions, level of engagment and how that affects test scores |
| Vaccination | Control vaccination during the pandemic | region/area, # of people vaccinated, # of vaccinations sites, # of vaccinations per day, demographic | large database | which demographic least likely to get vaccinated, how does # of sites affect vacccinations rates |
| Productivity | Determine work productivity | total hours worked, task completion time, number of tasks, time of day most tasks are completed, age, degree level, years of experience, stress levels | data can be stored in a SQL database as a table | time of day you're most productive, how # of tasks affect the rate you complete the tasks, may help in deciding which are the best hours for you to work, have a max # of tasks per day to complete to not feel overwhelmed |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
